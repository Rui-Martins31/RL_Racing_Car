# How to Run

Both the agent and the simulator (TORCS) should be run separately in two different terminals.

To run the simulator you should check the README in [TORCS Repository](https://github.com/fmirus/torcs-1.3.7).

A window will pop up after initializing the simulator. To test the agent we should start a race by clicking on *Race* -> *Quick Race* -> *New Race*.
The simulator will wait until the agent is started.

To run the agent, execute the following command in the terminal:
```
bash start_client.bash
```

The race should now start!
